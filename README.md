# Logistic Regression - Insurance Purchase Prediction

This is a simple yet insightful machine learning project where we use **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a person will buy insurance based on their age.

## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts if a person is likely to purchase insurance using only one feature: **age**. This serves as a great introduction to logistic regression and the basics of supervised machine learning.

We used:
- **Pandas** for data handling.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing the Logistic Regression model.
- A custom sigmoid function to understand the inner workings of logistic regression.

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset (`insurance_data.csv`) contains two columns:
- `age`: Age of the person.
- `bought_insurance`: Whether the person bought insurance (1) or not (0).

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

- How to implement logistic regression from scratch using Python.
- How to split data into training and testing sets.
- How to interpret model coefficients and make predictions.
- The importance of the sigmoid function in logistic regression.
