Insurance Purchase Prediction using Logistic Regression
Project Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to predict whether a person will buy insurance based on their age. The dataset (insurance_data.csv) contains age and a binary purchase indicator (0 or 1).

Key Steps
Data Loading & Exploration – Load and visualize data distributions.

Model Training – Train a logistic regression classifier.

Prediction & Evaluation – Test model accuracy.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas (Data Handling)

Matplotlib (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn  
Open and run the Jupyter notebook.

Results
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting insurance purchases, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification.
